# Day 14/100

✅ Deployed Task Manager application to production server  
✅ Configured complete server security (fail2ban, SSH keys, UFW firewall)  
✅ Set up PHP/Laravel with all required extensions and proper permissions  
✅ Implemented Nginx virtual host with automated SSL via Let's Encrypt/Certbot  
✅ Configured PostgreSQL database with dedicated user and permissions  
✅ Automated background services with Supervisor (queue workers) and cron (scheduler)  

**Reflection:**  
Intense deployment day! The Task Manager app is now live at [task-manager.jiordiviera.me](https://task-manager.jiordiviera.me/) with HTTPS enabled. I learned a tremendous amount about Linux server configuration, VPS security hardening, and Laravel service orchestration in production. Moving from local development to real deployment exposed me to many technical aspects: permission management, Nginx configuration, automation with Supervisor and cron jobs. It's incredibly satisfying to see the project publicly accessible and properly secured. Tomorrow I plan to enhance the app features and potentially add monitoring capabilities.
