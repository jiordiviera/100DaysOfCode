# Day 13/100

- Wired the DailyChallenge flow to surface the previous entry, highlight missing runs, and keep the journaling cadence front and center.
- Scheduled daily log nudges through a `SendDailyLogReminders` command paired with a `DailyLogReminder` notification so participants keep momentum.
- Delivered dedicated onboarding and challenge insights pages with supporting actions, badge evaluation logic, and configs to drive guided setup.
- Added user-facing depth: task comments, assignment workflows, user profiles, and badge tracking backed by fresh models and migrations.
- Reworked dashboard, project manager, and task manager Livewire screens to reflect daily progress, enforce active challenge validation, and provide richer feedback with new tests.

**Reflection:**
Major expansion dayâ€”between the onboarding journey, engagement reminders, and collaborative task features, the app now supports a full challenge lifecycle. Next up I want tighter streak metrics and more coverage on the new Livewire flows.
