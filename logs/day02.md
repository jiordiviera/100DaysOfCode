# Day 2/100

✅ Started first Laravel project (`task-manager`)  
✅ Set up initial `/tasks` route  

**Reflection:**  
Today I kicked off my first Laravel project for this challenge! Setting up the base and creating the `/tasks` route helped me get comfortable with Laravel’s routing system. Next, I’ll focus on controllers and connecting to a database.
