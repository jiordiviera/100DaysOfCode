# Day 9/100

- Migrated challenge and daily log forms to Livewire Flux components for cleaner UI and consistent styling.
- Tightened validation rules on challenge creation, daily entries, and login remember-me toggle.
- Integrated Flux assets into the app layout and refreshed the welcome page with Alpine-powered, fluid animations.

**Reflection:**
Today was about polishing the UX and wiring in Flux: the new components already make the forms feel sharper, and the welcome page finally moves with intention. Next up, I want to deepen the Flux adoption across the remaining screens and add tests around the new validation paths.
