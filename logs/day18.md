# Day 18/100

âœ… Created project roadmap with organized GitHub issues  
âœ… Started technical planning and ticket breakdown  
âœ… Implemented first AI fields in daily_logs migration  
âœ… Added database columns for AI-generated content (summary, tags, tips, share_draft)

**Reflection:**  
After two days of brainstorming and laying the foundation for the project vision, we finally got into the concrete work today ðŸŽ¯. Launched the planning phase and broke down features into organized tickets as GitHub issues, creating a clear and actionable roadmap.

First ticket completed âœ…: setting up the initial AI fields in `daily_logs` - this will allow the AI coach to automatically generate summaries, tags, tips for tomorrow, and draft social shares. This is the first real technical building block, marking the official start of the project ðŸš€.

Tomorrow I plan to continue with the AI integration and start building the core coaching logic.18/100
