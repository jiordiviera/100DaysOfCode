# Day 5/100

✅ Continued work on main project feature  
✅ Fixed a bug in the authentication flow  
✅ Improved UI responsiveness on mobile  

**Reflection:**  
Today I made solid progress on the core feature and resolved a tricky auth issue.  
I learned more about debugging async problems and responsive design.  
Tomorrow, I plan to start writing tests for the new functionality.
