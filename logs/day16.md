# Day 16/100

✅ Started brainstorming session for the AI coaching feature  
✅ Explored different approaches for automated progress analysis  
✅ Researched AI integration patterns in Laravel applications

**Reflection:**  
Today I began exploring the concept of an AI coach that could automatically analyze daily progress and provide personalized insights. Spent time researching different AI services and how they could integrate with the existing challenge tracking system. The goal is to make the daily reflection process more meaningful and actionable.

Tomorrow I plan to continue the brainstorming and start outlining the core features.
