# Day 17/100

✅ Continued brainstorming on AI coaching functionality  
✅ Defined core features: automated summaries, smart tags, daily tips  
✅ Outlined the project vision and user experience flow  
✅ Sketched database schema extensions for AI-generated content

**Reflection:**  
Second day of intensive brainstorming focused on crystallizing the AI coach concept. Identified key features like automatic progress summaries, intelligent tagging, personalized tips for tomorrow, and draft social sharing content. The vision is becoming clearer - an AI companion that helps users reflect more deeply on their progress and stay motivated.

Tomorrow I plan to start the technical planning and create actionable tickets.
