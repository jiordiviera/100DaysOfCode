# 100DaysOfCode

This repository tracks my journey through the **#100DaysOfCode challenge**.
The goal is simple: **code at least 1 hour per day for 100 consecutive days**, document progress, and share learnings.

## ðŸ“… Challenge Log

Each day, Iâ€™ll log my progress in the [`logs/`](./logs) folder and update this table:

| --- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
